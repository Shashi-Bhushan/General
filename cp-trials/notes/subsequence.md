## Check if a String s is subsequence of another String t

Check this [problem](https://github.com/Shashi-Bhushan/trials/blob/master/cp-trials/src/main/java/in/shabhushan/cp_trials/dynamic_programming/Subsequence.java)

It could be solved using recursion or dynamic programming, but the better solution is to just iterate over the String and check.
