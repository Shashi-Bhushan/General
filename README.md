# General

For General Purpose projects Setup
This repository contains some General Purpose code, keeping it 
for my understanding and also keeping a log for what i've been 
learning.

As Bruce Eckel wrote in his book 'Thinking in Java', the satisfaction of re-writing a class is in getting things right. So i keep practicing something every now and then. This repository is primary playground for those trials. Hence the name.

## Google Protocol Buffer

Did a PoC on Google's Protocol Buffer library.
This Sub-Project contains code for Serialization, JAX-B API and 
Google Protocol Buffer and a comparison of three methods of objects persistence in java. 


## Algo Trials

My primary playground for doing algorithmic trials. Reading Robert Sedgewick's Algorithms nowadays and I put my solutions for exercises given in the book in this tutorial. Some other utils as well.
